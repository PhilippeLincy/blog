description: Children are given their own small djembe (drum) to play and experience the joy of drumming and the exciting percussive sounds of the Balaphon, Talking Drum, Shekere, Shakers, Bells and Dununba from West Africa. Led by percussionist, Philippe Lincy, children experience a magical way of communicating through beat and sound, chanting, call and response games, rhythm patterns and dance! Like a heartbeat, drumming connects us all. It triggers the imagination, develops our ability to listen, itâ€™s fun, energetic and a magical way to communicate.
