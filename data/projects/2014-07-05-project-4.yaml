description: Doudoumba presents an exciting, educational and audience participatory program, bringing the magic and tradition of West Africa to the youth of Australia. Performed and hosted by Philippe Lincy and Yaw Glymin, the performance not only inspires and immerses the audience in the rhythm, ceremony and ritual of the drums, but also informs of the content and occasion in which they are performed. The ‘Senesounia’ for example, is a drumbeat that s played to farmers out in the field to give inspiration and dynamism to the rhythm of their work. There are rhythms for the people and rhythms for special rituals. The West African instruments explored in the performance are Dununba; Dondon; Tama; Sanza; Shekera; Atenteben; Sangban and Kenkeni. Please refer to the [program leaflet](files/flyers/themagicofdrumming.pdf) for information and program details.
